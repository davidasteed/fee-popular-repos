# GitHub Repos

A small app to display github repos for practice at The Iron Yard.  The assignment introduces the custom directive in AngularjS.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, then run:

1.  npm install to update the package.json
2.  run an http server in the `src/` directory.

Be sure to type in GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to authenticate with GitHub.
